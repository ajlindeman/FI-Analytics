    "  * Don't really see any time-dependence here\n",
    "  * Similarly the policy won't depend on position, \n",
    "  * So perhaps it doesn't depend on wealth, and it's a constant \n",
    "  * Bid and ask spreads won't be symmetric - the asymmetry should be controlled by $\\mu$ and the relative arrival rates of buy and sell orders (and relative buy and sell sizes).\n",
